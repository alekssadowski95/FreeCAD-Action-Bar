# FreeCAD-Action-Bar
FreeCAD faces the problem of displaying its vast number of functions in the GUI.

Modern MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) face the same issue with displaying skills of the players character. 
These games have solved this issue by offering the user a collection of empty slots, usually arranged in a grid, where the user can insert their needed skills and arrange them to their liking. The slots also display keyboard shortcuts directly in the GUI. This solution is usually called an "action bar"

This solution brings 3 unique advantages:
1. Users get intuitively accustomed to keyboard shortcuts, which lets them work faster.
2. Users can create their own workflows by arranging a collection of commands they usually use. This can be extended to allow users to group functions form different workbenches. The workflows can be then also shared in the form of configurations.
3. Individual functions can be subsequently added by the system to the users action bar, enabling a way of gamifying the new user experience in FreeCAD. The user unlocks new functions after completing different tutorials.
